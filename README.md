Multi - level implementation
Quest system
Advanced input combat system
NPC crowd system
Enemy AI system
Project Deliverables:

Clear Concept and Design Document:
Develop a well-defined concept for your game, including its mechanics, story, characters, levels, and overall gameplay experience.
Create a detailed design document that outlines all aspects of your game. This document will serve as a roadmap for your development process.
Functional Prototype:
Create a functional prototype of your game that showcases the core gameplay mechanics, controls, and basic interactions. This prototype should demonstrate the feasibility of your game concept.
3D Environment:
Design and create a visually appealing 3D environment using Unreal Engine's tools or assets found online. Pay attention to lighting, textures, materials, and environmental details to enhance immersion. While creating your own assets is allowed, using existing assets is encouraged.
Character and Animation:
Using characters that align with your game's theme and mechanics is encuraged.

Integrate suitable sound effects and background music that enhance the atmosphere and gameplay, contributing to a more immersive experience.
User Interface (UI) Design:
Design an intuitive and visually pleasing user interface, including menus, HUD elements, and in-game prompts that facilitate player interaction and navigation.
Bug Testing and Quality Assurance:
Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve bugs, glitches, and gameplay inconsistencies, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable player experience.
Optimization for Performance:
Optimize your game for performance, aiming for smooth operation on available hardware configurations without significant frame rate drops or technical issues.
Presentation and Documentation:
Prepare a comprehensive presentation that showcases your game's development process, including gameplay footage, design choices, technical challenges, and your overall experience.
Provide well-organized documentation that outlines game mechanics, controls, and any technical aspects.
Include a 30-second "commercial quality" video that showcases gameplay and the overall experience of your game.
